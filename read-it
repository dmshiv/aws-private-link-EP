############### most importantly execute (chmod +x your user data script) your script before applying anything else health check fails for EC2 .

There are two folder

one for consumer thats has vpc end point

another vpc end point services (aws private link)

a. first tf apply vpc end point services (provider) then gives a output : service name

b.that service name is needed by vpc end point (consumer)

terraform apply -auto-approve -var="endpoint_service_name=$(cd ../provider-EPS && terraform output -raw endpoint_service_name)"

here what you are doing is fectching that service name output and giving it as a variable to consumer

done Tf built

c.on consumer and provider first ssh into your pub ec2 and then private ec2

on consuer private ec2

up on doing

curl http://"vpce-0ceb7936c6c5cfb21-ylwjnuzv.vpce-svc-0a32e9af2aa94827b.eu-central-1.vpce.amazonaws.com" .........(dns of vpc end point )

you must get html content from private ec2 provider

basically whats happening inorder to access as above and to est a communication between two private ec2 across diff vpc's

consumer need end point (taking service) ,provider need end point services (offering its service).

how to dstroy it

a. first destroy vpc end point services (provider) folder >>>>>>>>>>>>>vpc end point services wont be destroyed shows an eroor beacause another folder is using it ......leave it there

b.come to end point (consumer) folder apply tf destroy >>>>>>>>it destroys and detaches from end point services (above)

c.then again go to point a. apply tf destroy

done
